I am someone who loves to read more about history and coding in my free time. My most recent book I have been really into is [Destiny Disrupted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34617904-destiny-disrupted).

I am from Algeria, and the colors on the [flag ](#Algerian-American-Software-Engineer) represent Islam and agriculture (green), purity (white), and the blood of the martyrs of our fight for independence (red).
